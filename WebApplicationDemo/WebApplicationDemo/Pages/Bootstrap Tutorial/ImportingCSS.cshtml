    <img src="/lib/Images/Client-Side Manager Window.png" alt="Client-Side Manager Window" class="mb-5 img-screenshot" />
    <p>Once you select an option, you choose which files you want to import and then click "Install". If you were adding css classes, you can just apply them to html elements. There is no need directly reference the newly imported files.</p>
