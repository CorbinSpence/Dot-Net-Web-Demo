        To setup your first asp.net core app, you need to navigate to File -> New -> Project. There you will be given a selection of project templates to create. Choose "ASP.NET Core Web App" and click next. The main areas you want to change are the storage location and name of the project. Keep in mind that the preset path for the project is not always to the folder you are on. Once you finish the setup, an entire framework and template will be generated.
